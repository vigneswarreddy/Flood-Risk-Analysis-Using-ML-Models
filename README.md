Recently, in forecasting systems, Machine Learning (ML) is being utilized to build efficient and accurate systems. In this work, ML algorithms Linear, Ridge, Lasso, Polynomial, Support Vector, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and Bayesian Ridge Regression (BRR) are trained using publicly available flood prediction dataset and investigated for their effectiveness. The performance of each model is measured using MSE, RMSE, MAE, and R-squared (R2). Out of all the models, BRR shows the best performance with an R2 value of 1.00. Using the techniques of Explainable AI, namely LIME and SHAP, we further elucidate the model to help obtain greater transparency and reliability of results in predictions keywords: {Analytical models;Predictive models;Vectors;Public security;Bayes methods;Floods;Reliability;Risk management;Regression tree analysis;Random forests;flood prediction;machine learning;bayesian ridge regression;explainable AI;LIME;SHAP},URL:Â https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10859855&isnumber=10859288
